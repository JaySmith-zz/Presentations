Creating S.O.L.I.D. Applications: Part 1 - Single Responsibility
This series of sessions will go over several core Object Oriented Principles.  In this session we will look at the Single Responsibility Principle, how to detect if we have broken it and some ways to modify our code to get to single responsibility.

FYI: The Principles in S.O.L.I.D are:
                The Single Responsibility Principle
                The Open-Close Principle
                The Liskov Substitution Principle
                The Interface Segregation Principle
                The Dependency Inversion Principle
